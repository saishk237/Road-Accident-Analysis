        Road accidents are a significant concern worldwide, causing countless
        injuries and fatalities each year. This mini-project aims to leverage
        the power of Microsoft Power BI to analyze road accident data, helping
        stakeholders make informed decisions and take proactive measures to
        enhance road safety.
      </p>

      <p>
        The project begins by collecting and cleaning road accident data from
        reliable sources, such as government agencies or traffic authorities.
        Subsequently, Power BI will be used to create a user-friendly and
        interactive dashboard, allowing users to explore various facets of road
        accidents, including:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Geographic Analysis: Visualize accident hotspots and identify areas
          with the highest incident rates.
        </li>
        <li>
          Time Trends: Explore accident patterns over time, such as daily,
          monthly, or seasonal variations.
        </li>
        <li>
          Contributing Factors: Analyze the factors contributing to accidents,
          such as weather conditions, road type, and driver demographics.
        </li>
        <li>
          Severity Assessment: Assess accident severity based on factors like
          the number of casualties and vehicles involved.
        </li>
        <li>
          Intervention Effectiveness: Evaluate the impact of safety measures,
          such as traffic signals or speed limits, on accident reduction.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        The Power BI dashboard will provide an intuitive interface for users to
        filter and drill down into the data, making it a valuable tool for
        government agencies, law enforcement, and safety advocates. The project
        aims to enhance road safety by identifying trends and areas that require
        immediate attention, ultimately reducing the frequency and severity of
        road accidents.
